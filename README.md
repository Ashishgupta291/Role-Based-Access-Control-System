Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
This project implements a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, focusing on secure user authentication, authorization, and role management. The system is backend-focused, designed to ensure users can access features and resources according to their assigned roles (Admin, Moderator, or User).

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **User Registration**: Allows users to sign up by providing a username, password, and selecting a role (User, Moderator, Admin).
- **User Login**: Secure login functionality using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to authenticate users.

### 2. Role-Based Authorization
- **Role-Specific Privileges**:
  - **Admin**: Full access to administrative dashboards and high-level system controls.
  - **Moderator**: Access to moderation features and specific resources.
  - **User**: Standard access to basic functionalities.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensures only authorized users can access endpoints based on their roles.

### 3. Session Management
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Maintains user sessions securely.
- **Logout Functionality**: Invalidates tokens, ensuring secure session termination.

### 4. Modular and Scalable Architecture
- **Modular Backend Structure**: Designed for easy scalability and maintenance.
- Separation of concerns for authentication, authorization, and resource management.

### 5. Test Endpoints
Endpoints for testing role-based access control functionality:
- **User Profile**: Accessible to all logged-in users.
- **Moderator Dashboard**: Restricted to moderators and above.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Restricted to admins.

## Key Highlights

### Flask as Backend Framework
- Lightweight and modular, providing a clean API for managing routes and middleware.
- Simplified user-role mapping and database interactions.

### JWT-Based Security
- JSON Web Tokens secure API endpoints, allowing stateless authentication.

### Scalable and Modular Design
- Dedicated modules for each roleâ€™s functionality ensure better maintainability.

### Custom Error Handling
- Unified response structure for errors and successful operations.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python's package installer)

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ashishgupta291/Role-Based-Access-Control-System.git
    cd Role-Based-Access-Control-System
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
    Using Flask-Migrate or manually:
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    ```

## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file (`config.py`) to manage application settings such as the secret key for JWT. 

Set the following environment variables:

- `FLASK_APP=app.py`
- `FLASK_ENV=development`
- `SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key` (Change to a secure key)

## Usage

### Running the Application
To start the Flask application, run:
```bash
python app.py
